This theme in our celebratory year is \"We Keep Us Safe.\"\"We Keep Us Safe\" is a call to action from community organizers, disability justice practitioners, abolitionists, queer, immigrant, and BIPOC communities who have demonstrated that we all deserve more safety and justice than our current systems provide.  In our increasingly uncertain and volatile times, we invite all of us to create true safety by nurturing relationships of collective care, mutual aid, and solidarity while refusing binaries of “us vs. them.”  “We Keep Us Safe\" is an invitation to radically envision collective safety: as a shared responsibility to love and protect each other, especially those most impacted by injustice.This year’s Forum will feature Yosimar Reyes (writer, poet, performer and Santa Clara Poet Laureate), Terisa Siagatonu (award-winning poet, teaching artist, mental health educator, and community leader), and Zachary Norris (former executive director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, author, organizer, and advocate).",
